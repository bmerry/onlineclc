INTRODUCTION

    OnlineCLC is a command-line wrapper around the compiler provided by an
    OpenCL implementation. It can be used to verify the correctness of code
    from the command line, save binary programs produced by the compiler, and
    view the build log to see warnings or performance hints from the compiler.

    It thus requires a working OpenCL library to run,
    and the results will depend on the OpenCL implementation that is
    provided.

    Command-line options are passed through to the underlying OpenCL compiler,
    except for the following:

       -b machine          Specify device to use
       -o outfile          Specify output file
       -h | --help         Show usage

    If no output file is specified, the compilation serves only to see the
    build log and no binary file is saved.

    OnlineCLC currently requires a POSIX 2001 system.

INSTALLATION

    OnlineCLC is distributed as source. Firstly, a build must be configured by
    running

        $ ./waf configure [--cl-headers=/path/to/opencl/headers]

    The CL headers path is the directory containing CL/cl.h. Run ./waf --help
    to see additional options, particularly with regards to the installation
    path.

    To build OnlineCLC, run

        $ ./waf build

    To install it once built, run (as root)

        # ./waf install

LIMITATIONS

    Currently mmap(2) is used to access the source and output file, so they
    cannot be piped.
